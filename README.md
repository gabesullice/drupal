Drupal
===

Drupal is an open source content management platform supporting a variety of
websites ranging from personal weblogs to large community-driven websites. For
more information, visit the Drupal website, [Drupal.org][Drupal.org], and join
the [Drupal community][Drupal community].

## Contributing

Drupal is developed on [Drupal.org][Drupal.org], the home of the international
Drupal community since 2001!

[Drupal.org][Drupal.org] hosts Drupal's [GitLab repository][GitLab repository],
its [issue queue][issue queue], and its [documentation][documentation].

## Usage

For brief introduction, see [USAGE.md](/USAGE.md). You can also find guides,
API references, and more by visiting Drupal's [documentation
page][documentation].

You can quickly extend Drupal's core featureset by installing any of its
[thousands of free and open source modules][modules]. With Drupal and its
module ecosystem, you can often build most or all of what your project needs
before writing a single line of code.

## Changelog

Drupal keeps detailed [change records][changelog]. You can search Drupal's
changes for a record of every notable breaking change and new feature since
2011.

## Security

page][Security advisories] (available as [an RSS feed][security RSS]). This
page also describes how to subscribe to these announcements via email.
